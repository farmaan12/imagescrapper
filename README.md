# ImageScrapper-Heroku App

## How it Works:

1. User gives a keyword for image search
2. The Keyword would be searched in Google Images
3. The Results would be displayed to the user and stored in a folder
4. If the user searches the same keyword, the already downloaded images in folder will be deleted and replaced by new images
